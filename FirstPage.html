<p> When God said " you are my child and I will always protect you" , I knew how blessed i am. I just need to focus on my goals and believe that with Him I will be able to reach them. I am very simple minded and one thing I believe in over everything is God. As for my passion, goal and ambitions. I am self-motivated and I have pride in my work.</p>
